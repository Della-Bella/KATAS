# My JavaScript Kata Practice Journey

Welcome to my JavaScript Kata practice repository! üëã

## Description

This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to JavaScript programming challenges (Katas), sourced from platforms like Codewars. It documents my progress as I learn and practice fundamental JavaScript concepts, one Kata at a time.

The goal is to tackle these challenges regularly (aiming for daily practice!) to solidify my understanding and build problem-solving skills in JavaScript.

## ‚ú® Live Demo ‚ú®

You can view the Katas presented in a styled, portfolio-like format on Netlify:

*(This site showcases the Kata solutions implemented within simple HTML and CSS card layouts.)*

## Goals

*   To consistently practice JavaScript fundamentals (conditionals, loops, arrays, strings, etc.).
*   To improve my logical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
*   To become more fluent and comfortable writing JavaScript code.
*   To build a small, visual portfolio demonstrating my learning progress.

## What's Inside

*   **JavaScript Code:** Solutions for various Katas, focusing on different methods and logic as I learn them. Each solution is typically presented within the context of the Kata's requirements.
*   **HTML (`index.html`):** Structures the web page to display the Katas in a card format.
*   **CSS (`style.css`):** Provides the modern, clean styling and layout for the cards and the page, using techniques like CSS Grid/Flexbox.

## Learning Focus

Currently focusing on beginner Katas (like 8 kyu on Codewars) covering areas such as:

*   Conditional Statements (`if`/`else`)
*   Modulo Operator (`%`)
*   Basic Functions
*   String Manipulation (Upcoming)
*   Array Methods (Upcoming)
*   And more as I progress!
